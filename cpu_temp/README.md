**To predict the CPU Temperature**
- I have a Raspberry Pi running as a web hosting server, and I have set up a script to record the CPU Temperature since 2014. 
- With all the data collected, and the server is in a pretty stable status, it might make sense to predict the CPU Temperature based on the historical data.
- The project is created in May-03, 2020, and it will be updated on regular basis.
